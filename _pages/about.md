I am a senior at Middlebury College from Hillsborough, North Carolina, pursuing a double major in geography and biology.
My first love is the study of organisms and their habitats out in the field, but more recently I have discovered the power of GIS and other geographical techniques to offer valuable insights to the field of conservation ecology.
Some of my favorite projects thus far have been [mapping potential amphibian road crossing sites](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F5kLZJaOvtm-DX1jmtvu-vBf79PCkh1j/view?usp=drive_link) in the town of Middlebury, using elevation data to analyze the topographical impact of mountaintop removal mining in West Virginia, and examining the [deforestation spillover effects](https://sites.middlebury.edu/arlutz351/leakage-and-blockage/) of protected areas.
Outside of class, I serve as Head Guide for the collegeâ€™s outing club and race for the mountain bike team.
I also love trail running in terrible weather, snowboarding, and overly elaborate baking projects.\

This semester, I am taking a class with Professor Joe Holler called [Open GIScience.](http://opengisci.github.io)
This blog follows my journey through the course as I learn about both the theory of open source GIS and the practice of reproducibility and replicability. You can also find full-length reports from studies that I have reproduced with the help of my classmates, Professor Holler, and others before me. \
